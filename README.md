### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a self taught web designer. My name is *Avirup Ghosh* and I am a Pharmacist but I love computers and specially coding. I started with WordPress and qickly fall in love with it. Curently I onlyl make WordPress themes and plugins for myself. I am still learning things and building an website at the same time.

I recently found about this secret of the GitHub so I didnot waste any time to jump into it. âœ¨âœ¨

My website has already compleated but my current financial situation does not give me enough confidance to buy an domain, SSL certificate and pay for AWS at the same time. Once my website is online I will make all my repositories available publically. ðŸ˜Š

### Goles of 2020

ðŸŒŸ Learn more and more during lockdown.\
ðŸŒŸ Try to publish few static GitHub Pages.\
ðŸŒŸ Try ti kickstart blog.
