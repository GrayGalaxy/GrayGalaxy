### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I am *Avirup Ghosh*, a self-taught web designer. I am a Pharmacist, but I love computers and specially coding. I started with WordPress and quickly fall in love with it. Currently I only make WordPress themes and plugins for myself. I am still learning things and building a website at the same time.

I recently found about this secret repo of the GitHub, so I did not waste any time to jump into it. âœ¨âœ¨
